## ELinks 0.13.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

  ## document.uri_passing
  #  Rules for passing URIs to external commands. When one rule is defined the
  #  link and tab menu will have a menu item that makes it possible to pass the
  #  the link, frame or tab URI to an external command. If several rules are
  #  defined the link and tab menu will have a submenu of items for each rule.
  #
  #  Note, this is mostly useful for launching graphical viewers, since there is
  #  no support for releasing the terminal while the command runs. The action
  #  and submenus are also available by binding keys to the
  #  frame-external-command, the link-external-command, and the
  #  tab-external-command actions.

  #  HTTP-specific options.

    ## protocol.http.user_agent <str>
    #  Change the User Agent ID. That means identification string, which is sent
    #  to HTTP server when a document is requested. The 'textmode' token in the
    #  first field is our silent attempt to establish this as a standard for new
    #  textmode user agents, so that the webmasters can have just a single
    #  uniform test for these if they are e.g. pushing some lite version to them
    #  automagically.
    #
    #  Use " " if you don't want any User-Agent header to be sent at all. URI
    #  rewriting rules may still include parameters that reveal you are using
    #  ELinks.
    #
    #  %v in the string means ELinks version,
    #  %s in the string means system identification,
